# Running locally
This project is still a work in progress, but the back end is currently in a working state. It requres a mysql server running on your machine. Once that is set up, run from the root directory:```go run .```

The front end uses SvelteKit, and can be run by navigating to the `frontend` directory and running ```npm run dev```

You should now be able to log in using the signin link in the go logs.
